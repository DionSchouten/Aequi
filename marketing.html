      <p>The Aequi marketing campaign is about people trying to live healthy or already live a healthy lifestyle, but also like doing things that make them happy. Having a beer with their friends or going to a diner and eat what they want without any concerns about it later, is the goal. The campaign message is all about finding the balance in your life and doing the things that make you truly happy, even if this is means being healthy sometimes. <br><br>
	  For promotional activities, we from Aequi dived into the realm of content creating and tried to spread the message about our brand. For example, we shared a perfect recipe for staying healthy, and it is very well paired with a nice Aequi beer. We also posted a sketch of a workout that people could do from home using our Aequi beer. That might sound weird, but this was made as a lighthearted joke to entertain our target audience. We also had a release stream on Twitch.Tv, where we taste-tested our beer, live with an audience of around 30 live viewers. From this, we gathered some clips and posted these to our TikTok and Instagram pages.</p>
		
      <h4 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Objectives</h4>
      	<h6 class="fw-bold">Reach Objectives</h6>
			<p><i>Instagram</i> - <strong>2000</strong> People will view the content from our campaign.  We will use Instagram because we noticed that this was the primary social media used daily by our target audience. <br><br>
			<i>TikTok </i> - <strong>1000</strong> People  will view the content from our campaign.  
     		We will use TikTok because people can consume content quicker, since it is short video format based. The algorithm also makes it relatively easy to gain a set amount of views.
	  		<br><br>
			<i>YouTube </i> - <strong>200</strong> People  will view the content from our campaign.  
      		We will use YouTube because we thought that if we could entertain our audience with videos related to our brand visions, we believe that would increase the likeliness of our brand.
	  		<br><br>
			We set the goal of reaching a total amount of <strong>3200</strong> views on our campaign in total, because our time was limited. We had little to no experience with creating content on these platforms.  </p>
			<br>
	  <h6 class="fw-bold">Affect Objective  </h6>
	  	<p>We want the people who view our campaign to feel influenced and motivated to go and find the balance in their life by doing the things that are healthy for them and doing the things that make them happy.</p>	
		<br>
	  <h6 class="fw-bold">Response objectives </h6>
	  	<p>After viewing content from our campaign, we want our target audience to stay updated with what we are producing and when we come up with new products. Therefore we want them to follow our social media. But we also want them to visit our website and represent themselves as someone trying to find the balance in their lives. </p>
		
      <h4 class="mt-4 fw-bold">Learning Points</h4>
      	<p>We saw significant growth with this tactic at the start. We started the Aequi campaign primarily on Instagram by posting lots of photo content about our brand and its vision. We instantly reposted this on our social media to gain initial attention. Still, almost immediately after, we noticed that we were not gaining new or additional views. With our goal being gaining 3200 views on our whole campaign, we started thinking about a different approach. We then came up with the idea to start making short video content, since this style gains a lot of initial views. After all, the content gets pushed way more on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube shorts. With this, we saw a massive gain in views. We started to get around 200-2000 views on single posts. This was great, and we began to lean more into the short video type of content. We did not expect this large of a difference between short video content and your standard phototype of content. <br><br>
      	At the end of our campaign, we reached 4650 views total on our social media campaign for Aequi. 1600 total views on TikTok, 3000 total views on Instagram, and 50 total views on our YouTube. We did not expect to reach this amount of views on TikTok or Instagram. The YouTube views were a bit lower than we expected, but this might be because this was our first post on YouTube, and we believe that if we were to put more time into this, we might see a bit of growth. We did not expect there to be such a significant difference between our Photos on Instagram and our "Reels." 
      	<br><br>
	  	Suppose we were to take a different approach for future Aequi campaigns, we will be a big supporter of leaning more towards the short video type content. Most social media platforms are shifting towards this method of content, which means that there should be more video-type content in our future campaigns. </p><br>
